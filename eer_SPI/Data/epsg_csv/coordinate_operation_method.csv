Latitude, P, and Longitude, L, in terms of Geographic Coordinate Reference System A may 
be expressed in terms of a geocentric (earth centred) Cartesian coordinate reference system X, Y, Z 
with the Z axis corresponding with the Polar axis positive northwards, the X axis through 
the intersection of the Greenwich meridian and equator, and the Y axis through the 
intersection of the equator with longitude 90 degrees E. If the prime meridian for geogCRS A is not 
Greewich, longitudes must first be transformed to their Greenwich equivalent. If the earth's 
spheroidal semi major axis is a, semi minor axis  b, and inverse flattening 1/f,  then

   XA=   (nu + hA) cos P cos L
   YA=   (nu + hA) cos P sin L
   ZA=  ((1 - e^2) nu + hA) sin P

where nu is the prime vertical radius of curvature at latitude P and is equal to 
   nu = a /(1 - e^2*sin^2(P))^0.5,
   P and L are respectively the latitude and longitude (related to Greenwich) of the point 
   h is height above the ellipsoid, (topographic height plus geoidal height), and
   e is the eccentricity of the ellipsoid where e^2 = (a^2 -b^2)/a^2 = 2f -f^2
                                                                                                                                                 
Cartesian coordinates in geocentric coordinate reference system B may be used to derive geographical coordinates in terms of geographic coordinate reference system B by:
   P   =  arctan (ZB + e^2* nu*sin P) / (XB^2 + YB^2)^0.5 by iteration
   L   = arctan YB/XB
   hB  =  XB sec L sec P  - nu

where LB is relative to Greenwich. If the geographic system has a non Greenwich prime 
meridian, the Greenwich value of the local prime meridian should be applied to longitude.

(Note that h is the height above the ellipsoid. This is the height value which is 
delivered by Transit and GPS satellite observations but is not the topographic 
height value which is normally used for national mapping and levelling operations. 
The topographic height is usually the height above mean sea level or an alternative 
level reference for the country. If one starts with a topographic height,  it will be 
necessary to convert it to an ellipsoid height before using the above transformation 
formulas. h = N + H, where N is the geoid height above the ellipsoid at the point 
and is sometimes negative, and H is the height of the point above the geoid. The 
height above the geoid is often taken to be that above mean sea level, perhaps with 
a constant correction applied. Geoid heights of points above the nationally used 
ellipsoid may not be readily available. For the WGS84 ellipsoid the value of N, 
representing the height of the geoid relative to the ellipsoid, can vary between 
values of -100m in the Sri Lanka area to +60m in the North Atlantic.)","Consider a North Sea point with coordinates derived by GPS satellite in the WGS 84 geographical coordinate system with coordinates of:

           latitude    53 deg 48 min 33.82 sec N, 
           longitude 02 deg 07 min 46.38 sec E, 
    and ellipsoidal height 73.0m, 

whose coordinates are required in terms of the ED50 geographical coordinate system which takes the International 1924 ellipsoid. The three parameter datum shift from WGS 84 to ED50 for this North Sea area is given as dX = +84.87m, dY = +96.49m, dZ = +116.95m. 

The WGS 84 geographical coordinates convert to the following geocentric values using the above formulas for X, Y, Z:

   XA = 3771 793.97m
   YA =   140 253.34m
   ZA = 5124 304.35m

Applying the quoted datum shifts to these, we obtain new geocentric values now related to ED50:

   XB = 3771 878.84m
   YB =   140 349.83m
   ZB = 5124 421.30m

These convert to ED50 values on the International 1924 ellipsoid as:
           latitude    53 deg 48 min 36.565 sec N, 
           longitude 02 deg 07 min 51.477 sec E, 
    and ellipsoidal height 28.02 m, 

Note that the derived height is referred to the International 1924 ellipsoidal surface and will need a further correction for the height of the geoid at this point in order to relate it to Mean Sea Level.","This is a parameter-less conversion.

As an alternative to the computation of the new latitude, longitude and height above ellipsoid in discrete steps through geocentric coordinates, the changes in these geographic coordinates may be derived directly by formulas derived by Molodenski. Abridged versions of these formulas, which are quite satisfactory for three parameter transformations, are as follows:

dlat "" = [(-dX*sin(lat)*cos(lon)) - (dY*sin(lat)*sin(lon)) + (dZ*cos(lat)) + (((a*Df) + (f*Da))*sin(2*lat))] / (rho * sin(1""))

dlon "" = (-dX*sin(lon) + dY*cos(lon)) / ((nu*cos(lat)) * sin(1""))

dh = (dX*cos(lat)*cos(lon)) + (dY*cos(lat)*sin(lon)) + (dZ*sin(lat)) + ((a*Df + f*Da)*(sin(lat)^2)) - da

where the dX, dY and dZ terms are the geocentric translation parameters, and rho and nu are the meridian and prime vertical radii of curvature at the given latitude (lat) on the first ellipsoid, da is the difference in the semi-major axes (a1 - a2) of the first and second ellipsoids and df  is the difference in the flattening of the two ellipsoids.

The formulas for dlat and dlon indicate changes in latitude and longitude in arc-seconds.","For a North Sea point with coordinates derived by GPS satellite in the WGS84 geographical coordinate reference system, with coordinates of:

           longitude lon_s             = 2°07'46.38""E, 
    and ellipsoidal height h_s = 73.0m, 

whose coordinates are required in terms of the ED50 geographical coordinate reference system which takes the International 1924 ellipsoid. 

The three geocentric translations parameter values from WGS84 to ED50 for this North Sea area are given as dX = +84.87m, dY = +96.49m, dZ = +116.95m. 
Ellipsoid Parameters are:

Then
da = 6378388  6378137 = 251
df = 0.003367003 - 0.003352811  = 1.41927E-05

Transformation of coordinates from one geographic coordinate reference system into another (also known as a ""datum transformation"") is usually carried out as an implicit concatenation of three transformations:
[geographical to geocentric >> geocentric to geocentric >> geocentric to geographic]

The middle part of the concatenated transformation, from geocentric to geocentric, is usually described as a simplified 7-parameter Helmert transformation, expressed in matrix form with 7 parameters, in what is known as the ""Bursa-Wolf"" formula:

   (Xt)             (  1       -Rz    +Ry)      (Xs)     (dX)
   (Yt)  =  M *  ( +Rz      1      -Rx)  *  (Ys)  + (dY)
   (Zt)              ( -Ry   +Rx       1 )      (Zs)      (dZ)

The parameters are commonly referred to defining the transformation ""from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system"", whereby (Xs, Ys, Zs) are the coordinates of the point in the source geocentric coordinate reference system and (Xt, Yt, Zt) are the coordinates of the point in the target geocentric coordinate reference system.  But that does not define the parameters uniquely; neither is the definition of the parameters implied in the formula, as is often believed.  However, the following definition, which is consistent with the Position Vector Transformation convention is common E&P survey practice, 

(dX, dY, dZ)   :Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to transform from source system to target system; also: the coordinates of the origin of the source coordinate reference system in the target coordinate reference system.

(Rx, Ry, Rz)   :Rotations to be applied to the point's vector.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the position vector when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate reference system in the positive direction of that axis; e.g. a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source system to target system will result in a larger longitude value for the point in the target system.  Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.

M                  :The scale correction to be made to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to obtain the correct scale in the target coordinate reference system. M = (1 + dS*10^-6), where dS is the scale correction expressed in parts per million.

Note: These formulas have been transcribed from EPSG Guidance Note #7-2. Users are encouraged to use that document rather than the text which follows as reference because limitations in the transcription will be avoided.

Although being common practice particularly in the European E&P industry, the Position Vector Transformation sign convention is not universally accepted.  A variation on this formula is also used, particularly in the USA E&P industry.  That formula is based on the same definition of translation and scale parameters, but a different definition of the rotation parameters.  The associated convention is known as the ""Coordinate Frame Rotation"" convention (EPSG coordinate operation method code 9607). 
The formula is:

   (X)             (  1      +Rz      -Ry)     (X)      (dX)
   (Y)  =  M *  ( -Rz       1      +Rx)  * (Y)  +  (dY)
   (Z)              ( +Ry   -Rx        1 )     (Z)       (dZ)

and the parameters are defined as:

(dX, dY, dZ)   : Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to transform from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system; also: the coordinates of the origin of source coordinate reference system in the target frame.

(Rx, Ry, Rz)   : Rotations to be applied to the coordinate reference frame.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation of the frame about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the coordinate reference frame when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate reference system in the positive direction of that axis, that is a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system will result in a smaller longitude value for the point in the target coordinate reference system. Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.

M                  : The scale factor to be applied to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system  in order to obtain the correct scale of the target coordinate reference system. M = (1+dS*10^-6), where dS is the scale correction expressed in parts per million.

In the absence of rotations the two formulas are identical; the difference is solely in the rotations. The name of the second method reflects this.

Note that the same rotation that is defined as positive in the first method is consequently negative in the second and vice versa.  It is therefore crucial that the convention underlying the definition of the rotation parameters is clearly understood and is communicated when exchanging datum transformation parameters, so that the parameters may be associated with the correct coordinate transformation method (algorithm).","The same example as for the Position Vector Transformation (coordinate operation method 9606) can be calculated, however the following transformation parameters have to be applied to achieve the same input and output in terms of coordinate values:

The two axes are orthogonal, but the unit on the I-axis is 25 metres, whilst the unit on the J-axis is 12.5 metres.
The target projected coordinate system is WGS 84 / UTM Zone 31N and the origin of the bin grid (centre of bin 0,0) is defined at E = 456781.0, N = 5836723.0.  The projected coordinate system point scale factor at the bin grid origin is 0.99984.
The map grid bearing of the I and J axes are 110* and 20* respectively.  Thus the angle through which both the positive I and J axes need to be rotated to coincide with the positive Easting axis and Northing axis respectively is +20 degrees.

General case.

The geometric representation of the affine transformation is:
XT = XT0   +  XS * k * MX * cos qX   +  YS * k * MY * sin qY
YT = YT0    XS * k * MX *  sin qX   +  YS * k * MY * cos qY 
where:

XT0 ,YT0  = the coordinates of the origin point of the source coordinate reference system, expressed in the target coordinate reference system;
MX , MY  = the length of one unit of the source axis, expressed in units of the target axis, for the first and second source and target axis pairs respectively;
qX , qY   = the angles about which the source coordinate reference system axes XS and YS must be rotated to coincide with the target coordinate reference system axes XT and YT respectively (counter-clockwise being positive).
k = point scale factor of the target coordinate reference system in a chosen reference point;
 
Comparing the algebraic representation with the parameters of the parameteric form (code 9624) it can be seen that the parametric and geometric forms of the affine transformation are related as follows:
A0  =  XT0
A1  = k * MX * cos qX  
A2  = k * MY * sin qY
B0  =  YT0
B1  =    k * MX * sin qX
B2  =   k *MY * cos qY

Reversibility
For the Affine Geometric Transformation, the reverse operation can be described by a different formula, as shown below, in which the same parameter values as the forward transformation may be used:

XS = [( XT   XT0) . cos qY    (YT  YT0) . sin qY ] / [k * MX  * cos (qX  qY)]
YS = [(XT    XT0) . sin qX   +  (YT  YT0) . cos qX ] / [k * MY * cos (qX  qY)]


Orthogonal case

If the source coordinate reference system happens to have orthogonal axes, that is both axes are rotated through the same angle to bring them into the direction of the orthogonal target coordinate reference system axes, i.e. qX = qY = q, then the Affine Geometric Transformation can be simplified to:

XT = XT0   +   XS .  k . MX . cos q   +   YS .  k .  MY  . sin q
YT = YT0      XS .  k .  MX . sin q    +   YS .  k .  MY  . cos q

where:
q  = the angle through which the source coordinate reference system axes must be rotated to coincide with the target coordinate refderence system axes (counter-clockwise is positive). Alternatively, the bearing (clockwise positive) of the source coordinate reference system Y-axis measured relative to target coordinate reference system north.

The reverse formulas of the general case can also be simplified by replacing qX and qY with q:

XS = [(XT   XTO) * cos q     (YT  YTO) * sin q ] / [k * MX ]
YS = [(XT    XTO) * sin q   +  (YT  YTO) * cos q] / [k * MY ]

In the EPSG dataset this orthogonal case (code 9622) has been deprecated. The formulas for the general case should be used, inserting q for both qX  and qY. The case has been documented here as part of the progression through increasing constraints on the degrees of freedom between the general case and the Similarity Transformation.",(none),,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",EPSG,2005-08-26,2004.67,0

This is a complex, multi-step transformation, involving the application of a geoid height difference interpolated at a point in a ""geoid model"". The geoid model should be available as a regular grid of latitude and longitude with the height of the geoid above the ellipsoid at each grid node. Only the height is affected by this transformation; the geodetic latitude and longitude are not.

The transformation involves the following sequence of steps:
·  Selection of a subset of the geoid file covering the extent of the points to be transformed.
·  If the geoid file is not based on the source or target CRS, it needs to be transformed first. This involves transformation of the chosen subset of the geoid file from its orignal Geographic 3D CRS to the Geographic 3D CRS that is the source or the target of this transformation.
·  Calculation of the height of the geoid above the ellipsoid (""geoid undulation"") at the relevant point(s). This is achieved through a bi-linear interpolation of the geoid undulation, using the latitude and longitude to locate the point in the sub-grid.  This step results in the height of the geoid above the ellipsoid (N) of the Geographic 3D CRS, whether source or target.

To eliminate high correlation between the translations and rotations in the derivation of parameter values for the Helmert transformation methods (coordinate operation method codes 9606 and 9607), instead of the rotations being derived about the geocentric coordinate reference system origin they may be derived at a location within the points used in the determination. Three additional parameters, the coordinates of the rotation point, are then required. The formula is:

   (Xt)             (  1       +Rz    -Ry)      (Xs - Xp)      (Xp)       (dX)
   (Yt)  =  M *  ( -Rz      1      +Rx)  *  (Ys - Yp)  +  (Yp)  +  (dY)
   (Zt)              ( +Ry   -Rx       1 )      (Zs - Zp)      (Zp)       (dZ)

and the parameters are defined as:

(dX, dY, dZ)   : Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in the source coordinate system in order to transform from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system; also: the coordinates of the origin of source coordinate reference system in the target frame.

(Rx, Ry, Rz)   : Rotations to be applied to the coordinate reference frame.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation of the frame about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the coordinate reference frame when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system in the positive direction of that axis, that is a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system will result in a smaller longitude value for the point in the target coordinate reference system. Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.

(Xp, Yp, Zp)   : Coordinates of the point about which the coordinate reference frame is rotated, given in the source Cartesian coordinate reference system. 

M                  : The scale factor to be applied to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system  in order to obtain the correct scale of the target coordinate reference system. M = (1+dS*10^-6), where dS is the scale correction expressed in parts per million.

Reversibility.
The Molodensky-Badekas transformation in a strict mathematical sense is not reversible, i.e. in principle the same parameter values cannot be used to execute the reverse transformation. This is because the evaluation point coordinates are in the forward direction source coordinate reference system and the rotations have been derived about this point. They should not be applied about the point having the same coordinate values in the target coordinate reference system, as is required for the reverse transformation. However, in practical application there are exceptions when applied to the approximation of small differences between the geometry of a set of points in two different coordinate reference systems. The typical vector difference in coordinate values is in the order of 6*10^1 to 6*10^2 metres, whereas the evaluation point on or near the surface of the earth is 6.3*10^6 metres from the origin of the coordinate systems at the Earths centre. This difference of four or five orders of magnitude allows the transformation in practice to be considered reversible. Note that in the reverse transformation, only the signs of the translations and rotation parameter values are reversed; the coordinates of the evaluation point remain unchanged.","Input point:

The simplest of all polynomials is the general polynomial function. In order to avoid problems of numerical instability this type of polynomial should be used after reducing the coordinate values in both the source and the target coordinate reference system to manageable numbers, between 10 and +10 at most.

Hence an evaluation point is chosen in the source coordinate reference system (XS0, YS0) and in the target coordinate reference system (XT0, YT0).  Often these two sets of coordinates do not refer to the same physical point but two points are chosen that have the same coordinate values in both the source and the target coordinate reference system.

The simplest of all polynomials is the general polynomial function. In order to avoid problems of numerical instability this type of polynomial should be used after reducing the coordinate values in both the source and the target coordinate reference system to manageable numbers, between 10 and +10 at most.  This is achieved by working with offsets relative to a central evaluation point, scaled to the desired number range by applying a scaling factor to the coordinate offsets.

Hence an evaluation point is chosen in the source coordinate reference system (XS0, YS0) and in the target coordinate reference system (XT0, YT0).  Often these two sets of coordinates do not refer to the same physical point but two points are chosen that have the same coordinate values in both the source and the target coordinate reference system.  (When the two points have identical coordinates, these parameters are conveniently eliminated from the formulas, but the general case where the coordinates differ is given here).

The selection of an evaluation point in each of the two coordinate reference systems allows the point coordinates in both to be reduced as follows:
XS - XS0 
YS - YS0
and
XT  XT0 
YT  YT0
These coordinate differences are expressed in their own unit of measure, which may not be the same as that of the corresponding coordinate reference system. )

A further reduction step is usually necessary to bring these coordinate differences into the desired numerical range by applying a scaling factor to the coordinate differences in order to reduce them to a value range that may be applied to the polynomial formulae below without introducing numerical precision errors:

U = mS.(XS - XS0) 
V = mS.(YS - YS0)

where 
XS , YS  are coordinates in the source coordinate reference system,
XS0 , YS0 are coordinates of the evaluation point in the source coordinate reference system,
mS is the scaling factor applied the coordinate differences in the source coordinate reference system.

The normalised coordinates U and V of the point whose coordinates are to be transformed are used as input to the polynomial transformation formula. In order to control the numerical range of the polynomial coefficients An and Bn the output coordinate differences dX and dY are multiplied by a scaling factor, mT.

mT.dX = A0 + A1.U + A2.V + A3.U^2 + A4.U.V + A5.V^2 + A6.U^3 + A7.U^2.V + A8.U.V^2 + A9.V^3

The polynomial coefficients are given as parameters of the form Aumvn and Bumvn, where m is the power to which U is raised and n is the power to which V is raised. For example, A13 is represented as coordinate operation parameter Au1v3.

The relationship between the two coordinate reference systems can now be written as follows:

	(XT - XT0) = (XS  XS0) + dX

	XT = XS  XS0  + XT0 + dX

The simplest of all polynomials is the general polynomial function. In order to avoid problems of numerical instability this type of polynomial should be used after reducing the coordinate values in both the source and the target coordinate reference system (CRS) to manageable numbers, between 10 and +10 at most.  This is achieved by working with offsets relative to a central evaluation point, scaled to the desired number range by applying a scaling factor to the coordinate offsets.

Hence an evaluation point is chosen in the source CRS (XS0, YS0) and in the target CRS (XT0, YT0).  Often these two sets of coordinates do not refer to the same physical point but two points are chosen that have the same coordinate values in both the source and the target CRS.  (When the two points have identical coordinates, these parameters are conveniently eliminated from the formulas, but the general case where the coordinates differ is given here).

The selection of an evaluation point in each of the two CRSs allows the point coordinates in both to be reduced as follows:

and

These coordinate differences are expressed in their own unit of measure, which may not be the same as that of the corresponding CRS.)

A further reduction step is usually necessary to bring these coordinate differences into the desired numerical range by applying a scaling factor to the coordinate differences in order to reduce them to a value range that may be applied to the polynomial formulae below without introducing numerical precision errors:

U = mS.(XS - XS0)
V = mS.(YS - YS0)

where
XS , YS  are coordinates in the source CRS,
XS0 , YS0 are coordinates of the evaluation point in the source CRS,
mS is the scaling factor applied the coordinate differences in the source CRS.

The normalised coordinates U and V of the point whose coordinates are to be transformed are used as input to the polynomial transformation formula. In order to control the numerical range of the polynomial coefficients An and Bn the output coordinate differences dX and dY are multiplied by a scaling factor, mT.

A general polynomial transformation is reversible only when the following conditions are met.
1. The co-ordinates of source and target evaluation point are (numerically) the same.
2. The unit of measure of the coordinate differences in source and target coordinate reference system are the same.
3. The scaling factors applied to source and target coordinate differences are the same.
4. The spatial variation of the differences between the coordinate reference systems around any given location is sufficiently small.

Clarification on conditions for polynomial reversibility:
Regarding 1 and 2 - 	In the reverse transformation the roles of the source and target coordinate reference systems are reversed.  Consequently, the co-ordinates of the evaluation point in the source coordinate reference system become those in the target coordinate reference system in the reverse transformation. Usage of the same transformation parameters for the reverse transformation will therefore only be valid if the evaluation point coordinates are numerically the same in source and target coordinate reference system and in the same units.  That is, XS0 = XT0 = X0 and YS0 = YT0 = Y0.
Re 3 - The same holds for the scaling factors of the source and target coordinate differences and for the units of measure of the coordinate differences. That is, mS = mT = m.
Re 4 - 	If conditions 1, 2 and 3 are all satisfied it then may be possible to use the forward polynomial algorithm with the forward parameters for the reverse transformation. This is the case if the spatial variations in dX and dY around any given location are sufficiently constant.  The signs of the polynomial coefficients are then reversed but the scaling factor and the evaluation point coordinates retain their signs. If these spatial variations in dX and dY are too large, for the reverse transformation iteration would be necessary.   It is therefore not the algorithm that determines whether a single step solution is sufficient or whether iteration is required, but the desired accuracy combined with the degree of spatial variability of dX and dY.

An example of a reversible polynomial is transformation is ED50 to ED87 (1) for the North Sea.  The suitability of this transformation to be described by a reversible polynomial can easily be explained. In the first place both source and target coordinate reference systems are of type geographic 2D. The typical difference in coordinate values between ED50 and ED87 is in the order of 2 metres (approximately 10E-6 degrees) in the area of application. The polynomial functions are evaluated about central points with coordinates of 55 deg N, 0 deg E in both coordinate reference systems. The reduced coordinate differences (in degrees) are used as input parameters to the polynomial functions. The output coordinate differences are corrections to the input coordinate offsets of about 10E-6 degrees. This difference of several orders of magnitude between input and output values is the property that makes a polynomial function reversible in practice (although not in a formal mathematical sense).

The error made by the polynomial approximation formulas in calculating the reverse correction is of the same order of magnitude as the ratio of output versus input:
(output error / input error) = (	output valu/ input value) which is approximately 10E-6

As long as the input values (the coordinate offsets from the evaluation point) are orders of magnitude larger than the output (the corrections), and provided the coefficients are used with changed signs, the polynomial transformation may be considered to be reversible.","See Reversible polynomial of degree 4, code 9651, for general methodology.",Reversibility is subject to constraints.

XT  = XS - XS0 + XT0 + dX
YT  = YS - YS0 + YT0 + dY

where
XT , YT      are coordinates in the target coordinate reference system,
XS , YS      are coordinates in the source coordinate reference system,
XS0 , YS0   are coordinates of the evaluation point in the source coordinate reference system,
XT0 , YT0   are coordinates of the evaluation point in the target coordinate reference system.

Note that the zero order coefficients of the general polynomial, A0 and B0, have apparently disappeared.  In reality they are absorbed by the different coordinates of the source and of the target evaluation point, which in this case, are numerically very different because of the use of two different projected coordinate reference systems for source and target.

See method code 9648 for description of general polynomial formula.

A general polynomial transformation is reversible only when the following conditions are met.
1. The co-ordinates of source and target evaluation point are (numerically) the same.
2. The unit of measure of the coordinate differences in source and target coordinate reference system are the same.
3. The scaling factors applied to source and target coordinate differences are the same.
4. The spatial variation of the differences between the coordinate reference systems around any given location is sufficiently small.

Clarification on conditions for polynomial reversibility:
Regarding 1 and 2 - 	In the reverse transformation the roles of the source and target coordinate reference systems are reversed.  Consequently, the co-ordinates of the evaluation point in the source coordinate reference system become those in the target coordinate reference system in the reverse transformation. Usage of the same transformation parameters for the reverse transformation will therefore only be valid if the evaluation point coordinates are numerically the same in source and target coordinate reference system and in the same units.  That is, XS0 = XT0 = X0 and YS0 = YT0 = Y0.
Re 3 - The same holds for the scaling factors of the source and target coordinate differences and for the units of measure of the coordinate differences. That is, mS = mT = m.
Re 4 - 	If conditions 1, 2 and 3 are all satisfied it then may be possible to use the forward polynomial algorithm with the forward parameters for the reverse transformation. This is the case if the spatial variations in dX and dY around any given location are sufficiently constant.  The signs of the polynomial coefficients are then reversed but the scaling factor and the evaluation point coordinates retain their signs. If these spatial variations in dX and dY are too large, for the reverse transformation iteration would be necessary.   It is therefore not the algorithm that determines whether a single step solution is sufficient or whether iteration is required, but the desired accuracy combined with the degree of spatial variability of dX and dY.

An example of a reversible polynomial is transformation is ED50 to ED87 (1) for the North Sea.  The suitability of this transformation to be described by a reversible polynomial can easily be explained. In the first place both source and target coordinate reference systems are of type geographic 2D. The typical difference in coordinate values between ED50 and ED87 is in the order of 2 metres (approximately 10E-6 degrees) in the area of application. The polynomial functions are evaluated about central points with coordinates of 55 deg N, 0 deg E in both coordinate reference systems. The reduced coordinate differences (in degrees) are used as input parameters to the polynomial functions. The output coordinate differences are corrections to the input coordinate offsets of about 10E-6 degrees. This difference of several orders of magnitude between input and output values is the property that makes a polynomial function reversible in practice (although not in a formal mathematical sense).

The error made by the polynomial approximation formulas in calculating the reverse correction is of the same order of magnitude as the ratio of output versus input:
(output error / input error) = (	output valu/ input value) which is approximately 10E-6

As long as the input values (the coordinate offsets from the evaluation point) are orders of magnitude larger than the output (the corrections), and provided the coefficients are used with changed signs, the polynomial transformation may be considered to be reversible.","See Reversible polynomial of degree 4, code 9651, for general methodology.",,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",EPSG,2003-09-22,,0

In Europe, national height systems are related to the pan-European height system through three transformation parameters and the formula:

Ht = Hs + A + [IncLat * rhoO * (Lat  LatO)] + [IncLong * nuO * (Long  LongO) * cos(Lat)]

where
Ht = gravity-related height value in the target vertical coordinate reference system.
Hs = gravity-related height value in the source vertical coordinate reference system.
A is the value of the vertical offset to be applied.
IncLat is the value in radians of the inclination parameter in the latitude domain, i.e. in the plane of the meridian, derived at an evaluation point with coordinates of LatO , LongO.
IncLon is the value of the inclination parameter in the longitude domain, i.e. perpendicular to the plane of the meridian.
rhoO is the radius of curvature of the meridian at latitude LatO, where rhoO = a(1  e^2)/(1  e^2 * sin^2(LatO))^1.5
nuO is the radius of curvature on the prime vertical (i.e. perpendicular to the meridian) at latitude LatO, wh		ere nuO = a /(1  e^2 * sin^2(LatO))^0.5
Lat , Long are the horizontal coordinates of the point in the ETRS89 coordinate reference system, in radians.
LatO , LongO are the coordinates of the evaluation point in the ETRS89 coordinate reference system, in radians.

The horizontal location of the point must always be given in ETRS89 terms.

The forward case is trivial. A 3-dimensional geographic coordinate reference system comprising of geodetic latitude, geodetic longitude and ellipsoidal height is converted to its 2-dimensional subset by the simple expedient of dropping the height.

The reverse conversion, from 2D to 3D, is indeterminate. It is however a requirement when a geographic 2D coordinate reference system is to be transformed using a geocentric method which is 3-dimensional. In practice an artificial ellipsoidal height is created and appended to the geographic 2D coordinate reference system to create a geographic 3D coordinate reference system referenced to the same geodetic datum. The assumed ellipsoidal height is usually either set to the gravity-related height of a position in a compound coordinate reference system, or set to zero.

For areas south of the equator the value of latitude lat will be negative and the formulas above, to compute the E and N,  will automatically result in the correct values. Note that the false northings of the origin, if the equator, will need to be large to avoid negative northings and for the UTM projection is in fact 10,000,000m. Alternatively, as in the case of Argentina's Transverse Mercator (Gauss-Kruger) zones, the origin is at the south pole with a northings of zero. However each zone central meridian takes a false easting of 500000m prefixed by an identifying zone number. This ensures that instead of points in 
different zones having the same eastings, every point in the country, irrespective of its projection zone, will have a unique set of projected system coordinates. Strict application of the above formulas, with south latitudes negative, will result in the derivation of the correct Eastings and Northings. 

Similarly, in applying the reverse formulas to determine a latitude south of the equator, a negative sign for lat results from a negative lat1 which in turn results from a negative M1.","For Projected Coordinate System OSGB 1936 / British National Grid

For the mapping of southern Africa a south oriented Transverse Mercator projection is used. Here the coordinate axes are called Westings and Southings and increment to the West and South from the origin respectively.  The standard Transverse Mercator formulas (coordinate operation method code 9807) need to be modified to cope with this arrangement with

Westing, W = FE - k0 nu[A + (1 - T + C)A^3/6 + (5 - 18*T + T^2 + 72*C - 58*e'^2)A^5/120]

Southing, S = FN - k0{M - M0 + nu*tan(lat)*[A^2/2 + (5 - T + 9*C + 4*C^2)A^4/24 + (61 - 58*T + T^2 + 600*C - 330*e'^2)A^6/720]}

In these formulas the terms FE and FN retain their definition, i.e. in the Transverse Mercator (South Orientated) method they increase the Westing and Southing value at the natural origin. In this method they are effectively false westing (FW) and false southing (FS) respectively.

For the reverse formulas, those for the standard Transverse Mercator above apply, with the exception that:

M1 = M0 - (S - FN)/k0
and D = -(W - FE)/(nu1*k0), with nu1 = nu for lat1","See Transverse Mercator, code 9807, for general methodology.",,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",EPSG,2002-07-31,2002.51,0

Given the geodetic origin of the projection at the tangent point (lat0, lon0), the parameters defining the conformal sphere are:

R= sqrt( rho0 * nu0)
n= {1 + [e^2 * cos^4(latC) / (1 - e^2)]}^0.5
c=  [(n+sin(lat0)) (1-sin(chi0))]/[(n-sin(lat0)) (1+sin(chi0))]

where:
sin(chi0) = (w1-1)/(w1+1)
w1 = (S1.(S2)^e)^n
S1 = (1+sin(lat0))/(1-sin(lat0))
S2 = (1-e sin(lat0))/(1+e sin(lat0))

The conformal latitude and longitude (chi0,lambda0) of the origin are then computed from :

chi0 = asin[(w2-1)/(w2+1)]

where S1 and S2 are as above and  w2 = c (S1(S2)^e)^n
 
lambda0  = lon0

For any point with geodetic coordinates (lat, lon) the equivalent conformal latitude and longitude (chi, lambda) are computed from 
lambda = n(lon-lambda0) + lambda0
chi = asin[(w-1)/(w+1)]

where w = c (Sa (Sb)^e)^n
Sa = (1+sin(lat))/(1-sin(lat))
Sb = (1-e.sin(lat))/(1+e.sin(lat))
 
Then B = [1+sin(chi) sin(chi0) + cos(chi) cos(chi0) cos(lambda-lambda0)]

N = FN + 2 R k0 [sin(chi) cos(chi0) - cos(chi) sin(chi0) cos(lambda-lambda0)] / B

E = FE + 2 R k0 cos(chi) sin(lambda-lambda0) / B


The reverse formulae to compute the geodetic coordinates from the grid coordinates involves computing the conformal values, then the isometric latitude and finally the geodetic values.

The parameters of the conformal sphere and conformal latitude and longitude at the origin are computed as above. Then for any point with Stereographic grid coordinates (E,N) :

chi = chi0 + 2 atan[{(N-FN)-(E-FE) tan (j/2)} / (2 R k0)]

lambda = j + 2 i + lambda0

where g = 2 R k0 tan(pi/4 - chi0/2)
h = 4 R k0 tan(chi0) + g
i = atan[(E-FE) / {h+(N-FN)}]
j = atan[(E-FE) / (g-(N-FN)] - i

Geodetic longitude lon = (lambda-lambda0 ) / n +  lambda0

Isometric latitude psi = 0.5 ln [(1+ sin(chi)) / { c (1-  sin(chi))}] / n

First approximation lat1 = 2 atan(e^psi)  - pi/2  where e=base of natural logarithms.

psii = isometric latitude at lati

where psii= ln[{tan(lati/2 + pi/4}  {(1-e sin(lati))/(1+e sin(lati))}^(e/2)]
 
Then iterate lat(i+1) = lati - ( psii - psi ) cos(lati) (1 -e^2 sin^2(lati)) / (1 - e^2)

until the change in lat is sufficiently small.

For Oblique Stereographic projections centred on points in the southern hemisphere,  the signs of E, N, lon0, lon,  must be reversed to be used in the equations and lat will be negative anyway as a southerly latitude.

An alternative approach is given by Snyder, where, instead of defining a single conformal sphere at the origin point, the conformal latitude at each point on the ellipsoid is computed.  The conformal longitude is then always equivalent to the geodetic longitude.  This approach is a valid alternative to the above, but gives slightly different results away from the origin point. It is therefore considered by EPSG to be a different coordinate operation method to that described above.","For Projected Coordinate System RD / Netherlands New

This grid is used as the basis for mineral leasing in Tunsia.  Lease areas are approximately 2 x 2 km or 400 hectares.  The corners of these blocks are defined through a six figure grid reference where the first three digits are an easting in kilometres and the last three digits are a northing.  The latitudes and longitudes for block corners at 2 km intervals are tabulated in a mining decree dated 1st January 1953.  From this tabulation in which geographical coordinates are given to 5 decimal places it can be seen that:
a)  the minimum easting is 94 km, on which the longitude is 5.68989 grads east of Paris.
b)  the maximum easting is 490 km, on which the longitude is 10.51515 grads east of Paris.
c)  each 2 km grid easting interval equals 0.02437 grads.
d)  the minimum northing is 40 km, on which the latitude is 33.39 grads.
e)  the maximum northing is 860 km, on which the latitude is 41.6039 grads.
f)  between 40 km N and 360 km N, each 2 km grid northing interval equals 0.02004 grads.
g)  between 360 km N and 860 km N, each 2 km grid northing interval equals 0.02003 grads.

Formulae are:

Grads from Paris

Lat (grads) = 36.5964 + [(N - 360) * A] 
where N is in kilometres and A = 0.010015 if N > 360, else A = 0.01002.

LonParis (grads) = 7.83445 + [(E - 270) * 0.012185], where E is in kilometres.

The reverse formulae are:

E (km) = 270 + [(LonParis - 7.83445) / 0.012185] where LonParis is in grads.

N (km) = 360 + [(Lat - 36.5964) / B] 
where Lat is in grads and B = 0.010015  if  lat>36.5964, else B = 0.01002.

Degrees from Greenwich.

Modern practice in Tunisia is to quote latitude and longitude in degrees with longitudes referenced to the Greenwich meridian.  The formulae required in addition to the above are:

Lat (degrees) =  (Latg * 0.9) where Latg is in grads.
LonGreenwich (degrees) = [(LonParis + 2.5969213) * 0.9] where LonParis is in grads.


Lat (grads) =  (Latd / 0.9) where Latd is in decimal degrees.
LonParis (grads) = [(LonGreenwich / 0.9) - 2.5969213)] where LonGreenwich is in decimal degrees.","For grid location 302598,

To compute the Lambert Conic Near-Conformal the following formulae are used. First compute constants for the projection:

n = f / (2-f)
A = 1 / (6 rhoO nuO) 
A = a [ 1- n + 5 (n^2 - n^3 ) / 4 + 81 ( n^4 - n^5 ) / 64]*pi /180 
B = 3 a [ n - n^2 + 7 ( n^3 - n^4 ) / 8 + 55 n^5 / 64] / 2
C = 15 a [ n^2 -n^3 + 3 ( n^4 - n^5 ) / 4 ] / 16
D = 35 a [ n^3 - n^4 + 11 n^5 / 16 ] / 48
E = 315 a [ n^4 - n^5 ] / 512
r0 = ko nu0 / tan(lat0)
s0 = A lat0 - B sin(2 latO) + C sin(4 latO) - D sin(6 latO) + E sin(8 latO) where in the first term lat0 is in degrees, in the other terms latO is in radians.

Then for the computation of easting and northing from latitude and longitude:

s = A lat - B sin(2 lat) + C sin(4 lat) - D sin(6 lat) + E sin(8 lat) where in the first term latO is in degrees, in the other terms latO is in radians.
m = s - sO
M = ko ( m + A m^3)
r = rO - M
theta = (lon - lonO) sin(latO)

and
E = FE + r sin(theta)
N = FN + M + r sin(theta) tan(theta/2) using the natural origin rather than the false origin.

The reverse formulas for latitude and longitude from Easting and northing are:

theta' = arctan {(E   FE) / [rO   (N   FN)]}
r' = +/- {(E   FE)^2 + [rO   (N   FN)]}^2}^0.5, taking the sign of latO 
M' = rO  r'

If an exact solution is required, it is necessary to solve for m and * using iteration of the two equations:
m'	=	m'  [ ko m'  ko A (m')3] / [ ko  3 ko A (m')2]
using M' for m' in the first iteration. This will usually converge (to within 1mm) in a single iteration. Then
lat' = lat' +{m' + sO  [A' lat' (180/pi)  B' sin(2 lat')  + C' sin(4 lat')    D' sin(6lat') + E' sin(8 lat')]}/ [A' (pi/180)]
first using lat' = latO + m'/ [A' (pi/180)].

However the following non-iterative solution is accurate to better than 0.001"" (3mm) within 5 degrees latitude of the projection origin and should suffice for most purposes:
m' = 	M'  [M' o M'  ko A (')^3] / [ ko  3 ko A (M')^2]
lat' = latO + m'/ [A' (pi/180)]
s' = 	' lat'   B' sin(2 lat')  + C' sin(4 lat')    D' sin(6 lat') + E' sin(8 lat')
		where in the fterm lat' is in degrees, in the other terms lat' is in radians.
ds' = 	A'(18pi)  2B' cos(2 lat')  + 4C' cos(4 lat')    6D' cos(6 lat') + 8E' cos(8 lat')
lat = lat'  [(m' + sO  s') / (ds')] radians

Then after solution of lat using either method above
lon = lonO + theta' / sin(latO) 	here lonO and lon are in radians.","For Projected Coordinate System: Deir ez Zor / Levant Zone

Oblique aspect
To derive the projected coordinates of a point, geodetic latitude (lat) is converted to authalic latitude (ß). The formulae  to convert geodetic latitude and longitude (lat,lon) to Easting and Northing are:

Easting, E   = FE + {(B . D) . [cos ß . sin(lon  lonO)]}
Northing, N = FN + (B / D) . {(cos ßO . sin ß)   [sin ßO . cos ß . cos(lon  lonO)]}

where
B = Rq . (2 / {1 + sin ßO . sin ß + [cos ßO . cos ß . cos(lon  lonO)]})^0.5
D = a . [cos latO / (1  e2 sin2 latO)^0.5] / (Rq . cos ßO)
Rq = a . (qP  / 2)^0.5
ß = asin (q / qP)
ßO = asin (qO / qP)
q = (1  e^2) . ([sin(lat) / (1  e^2 sin^2(lat))]  {[1/(2e)] . ln [(1  e sin(lat)) / (1 + e sin(lat))]})
qO = (1  e^2) . ([sin(latO) / (1  e^2 sin^2(latO))]  {[1/(2e)] . ln [(1  e sin(latO)) / (1 + e sin(latO))]})
qP = (1  e^2) . ([sin(latP) / (1  e^2 sin^2(latP))]  {[1/(2e)] . ln [(1  e sin(latP)) / (1 + e sin(latP))]})
where *P = p/2 radians, thus
qP = (1  e^2) . ([1 / (1  e^2)]  {[1/(2e)] . ln [(1  e) / (1 + e)]})

The reverse formulas to derive the geodetic latitude and longitude of a point from its Easting and Northing values are:

lat = ß' + [(e^2/3 + 31e^4/180 + 517e^6/5040) . sin 2ß'] + [(23e^4/360 + 251e^6/3780) . sin 4ß'] +  [(761e^6/45360) . sin 6ß']

lon = lonO + atan {(E-FE) . sin C / [D. rho . cos ßO . cos C  D^2. (N-FN) . sin ßO . sin C]}
where
ß' = asin{(cosC . sin ßO) + [(D . (N-FN) . sinC . cos ßO) / rho]}
C = 2 . asin(rho / 2 . Rq)
rho = {[(E-FE)/D]^2 + [D . (N FN)]^2}^0.5

and D, Rq, and ßO are as in the forward equations.

Polar aspect
For the polar aspect of the Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection, some of the above equations are indeterminate. Instead, for the forward case from latitude and longitude (lat, lon) to Easting (E) and Northing (N):

For the north polar case:
	Easting, E   = FE + [rho  sin(lon  lonO)]
	Northing, N = FN   [rho  cos(lon  lonO)]
where
rho = a (qP   q)^0.5
and qP  and q are found as for the general case above.

For the south polar case:
	Easting, E   = FE + [rho . sin(lon  lonO)]
	Northing, N = FN +  [rho . cos(lon  lonO)]
where
rho = a (qP  + q)^0.5
and qP  and q are found as for the general case above.

For the reverse formulas to derive the geodetic latitude and longitude of a point from its Easting and Northing:
lat = ß' + [(e^2/3 + 31e^4/180 + 517e^6/5040)  sin 2ß'] + [(23e^4/360 + 251e^6/3780)  sin 4ß'] +  [(761e^6/45360)  sin 6ß']
as for the oblique case, but where
ß' = ±asin [1 rho^2 / (a^2{1 [(1 e^2)/2e)) ln[(1-e)/(1+ e)]})], taking the sign of  latO
and rho = {[(E FE)]^2 + [(N  FN)]^2}^0.5

To derive the projected coordinates of a point, geodetic latitude (lat) is converted to authalic latitude (ß). The formulas to convert geodetic latitude and longitude (lat, lon) to Easting (E) and Northing (N) are:

and
C  = m1^2 +  (n . alpha1)
n   = (m1^2  m2^2) / (alpha2 - alpha1)
m1 = cos lat1 / (1  e^2 sin^2(lat1))^0.5

This method has one of the simplest formulas available. If the latitude of natural origin (latO) is at the equator the method is also known as Plate Carrée. It is not used for rigorous topographic mapping because its distortion characteristics are unsuitable. Formulas are included to distinguish this map projection method from an approach sometimes mistakenly called by the same name and used for simple computer display of geographic coordinates  see Pseudo Plate Carrée (coordinate operation method code 9825).

First calculate a constant for the projection:
nu_O = a /(1  e^2 sin^2(latO))^0.5

Then the forward conversion from latitude and longitude is given by:
nu = a /(1  e^2 sin^2(lat))^0.5
psi = atan [(1  e^2) tan(lat) + e^2 * nu_O * sin(latO)  / (nu * cos(lat))]
alpha = atan {sin (lon  lonO) / [cos(latO) * tan(psi)  sin(latO) * cos (lon  lonO)]}
G  = e sin(latO) / (1  e^2)^0.5
H = e cos(latO) * cos(alpha) / (1  e^2)^0.5
Then
if sin(alpha)) = 0,  s = asin (cos(latO) * sin(psi)  sin(latO) * cos(psi)) * SIGN(cos(alpha))
else                     s = asin [sin (lon  lonO) * cos(psi) / sin(alpha))

and in either case
c = nu_O * s {[1  s^2 * H^2 (1  H^2) /6] + [(s^3/8)GH(1-2H^2)] + (s^4/120)[H^2(4-7H^2)  3G^2(1-7H^2)]  [(s^5/48)GH]}

Then
	E = FE + * sin(alpha)
	N = FN + * cos(alpha)

For the reverse conversion from easting and northing to latitude and longitude:
	c' = [(E FE)^2 + (N  FN)^2]^0.5
alpha' = atan [(E  FE) / (N  FN)]
	A = e^2 * cos^2(latO) * cos^2(alpha') / (1  e^2)
	B 3e^2 * (1-A) * sin(latO) * cos(latO) * cos(alpha') / (1  e^2)
	D = c'nu_O
	J = D  [A (1 + AD^3 / 6]  [B (1 + 3A) D^4 / 24]
	K = 1  (* J^2 / 2)  (B *J^3 / 6)
psi' = asin (sin(latO) cos(J) + cos(latO) sin(J) cos(alpha'))

Then
lat = atan [(1  e^2 * K sin(latO) / sin(psi')) * tan(psi') / (1  e^2)]
lon = lonO + asin (sin(alpha') * sin(J) / cos(psi'))",See information source or EPSG Guidance Note 7.,Modified form of Oblique Azimuthal Equidistant projection method developed for Polynesian islands.
