Installation procedures
-----------------------

Documentation:
- Application and librairie documentation can be found under the Doc directory in your eer_SPI installation path

Compatibility:
This package has been compiled with gcc 3.3 an tested on the following system:

   - Debian (Sarge) 2.6.18.8-1

Assumptions:
- Installation and execution of the SPI software will be performed as a specific user and installed in the SPI directory of this user.
- All commands will be relative to the user's home directory (ie all install and working paths will start with ~/).
- The installation shell is sh compatible (can usually be obtained with the command $echo $SHELL)

Note to shell newbies, all commands used in this installation document can be explained by their online manual. To
access this manual, simply type:
   man <program name>

   1 System requirements:

     Hardware:

        Pentium IV 2Ghz
        1G ram
        16Mb Graphic card (NVIDIA por favor)
        3G Disk space (For installation)

     Software:

        Xvfb       (For batch mode)
        ImageMagik (For image output)

        XServer configured with 24 or 32 bit depth

   2 Installation:

   A) Packages description

      - Geographical database
         (on 2 CDs)
            DBGEO_R.zip (Raster data)
            DBGeo_T.zip (Texture data)
            DBGeo_V.zip (Vectorial data)

         (or a single global file)
            DBGeo.tgz

         (or a single north american file)
            northamericaDBGeo.tgz

      - The SPI application (Application CD)
         SPI-7.2.4a.tgz

   B) Decompressing the packages

      - You will need to install the geographical database (DBGEO_?.zip) first by decompressing it
        into it's final installation directory.

        This will take up to 2.3 Gig for the global coverage

          unzip DBGeo_R.zip -d [your geo_path]
          unzip DBGeo_T.zip -d [your geo_path]
          unzip DBGeo_V.zip -d [your geo_path]

          or

          tar -zxvf DBGeo.tgz -C [your geo_path]

      - Then you may go on with the SPI package by untarring it to a temporary
        directory since it will install itself somewhere else later.

         tar -zxvf SPI-7.2.3.tgz -C [your temp_path]

   C) Package installation

       - Call the "Install" script with the installation path as the first parameter
         This script will create a SPI directory and install itself there.
         At the end the install script will ask you for the geographical database path
         which you previously installed.

         ./Install [your spi_path]

            Enter the geographical database (GDB) path: [your geo_path]

   D) Profile setup.

      - If you want to run scripts, you will have to define an environment variable pointing to the path
        where you installed SPI. Depending on the shell you are using, this might mean:

        sh/ksh/bash

           add this line to the .profile or .profile_usr

           export SPI_PATH=[your spi_path]

        csh

           add this line to the .cshrc

           setenv SPI_PATH [your spi_path]

   E) Run SPI.

      - You can now launch SPI by calling

        [your  spi_path]/SPI

        or

        $SPI_PATH/SPI

        The first time you run it a setup window will popup for you to
        set default parameters.

        In the "Options" tab you may wish to setup a default printer and language.

        The other items should be fine as is. Just click Install and that's it

**** In case of problem with the OpenGL librairies, you can try to do the installation
     with the forcing parameter which will cause the librairies to be relinked and force
     the software OpenGL implementation to take precedence.

           ./Install [your spi_path] link
