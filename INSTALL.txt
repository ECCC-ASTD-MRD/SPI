Installation procedures
-----------------------

Documentation:
- Application and librairie documentation can be found on the CMC wiki at https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/SPI/Doc
- Example scritps and macro are available in the Demo directory of your SPI installation path

Compatibility:
This package has been compiled with gcc 4.1.2 an tested on the following system:

   - Debian (Sarge) 2.6.18

Assumptions:
- Installation and execution of the SPI software will be performed as a specific user and installed in the SPI directory of this user.
- All commands will be relative to the user's home directory (ie all install and working paths will start with ~/).
- The installation shell is ksh compatible (can usually be obtained with the command $echo $SHELL)

Note to shell newbies, all commands used in this installation document can be explained by their online manual. To
access this manual, simply type:
   man <program name>

   2 Installation:

   A) Packages description

      - Geographical database (GDB)
         (on 2 CDs)
            DBGEO_R.zip (Raster data)
            DBGeo_T.zip (Texture data)
            DBGeo_V.zip (Vectorial data)

         (or a single global file)
            DBGeo.tgz

         (or a single north american file)
            northamericaDBGeo.tgz

      - The SPI application (Application CD)
         SPI-x.x.x.tgz

   B) Decompressing the packages

      - You will need to install the geographical database (DBGEO_?.zip) first by decompressing it
        into it's final installation directory if it has'nt been installed before.

        This will take up to 2.3 Gig for the global coverage

          unzip DBGeo_R.zip -d [your geo_path]
          unzip DBGeo_T.zip -d [your geo_path]
          unzip DBGeo_V.zip -d [your geo_path]

          or

          tar -zxvf DBGeo.tgz -C [your geo_path]

      - Next, You may go on with the SPI package by untarring it to a temporary
        directory since it will install itself somewhere else later.

         tar -zxvf SPI-x.x.x.tgz -C [your temp_path]

   C) Package installation

       - Call the "Install" script with the installation path as the first parameter
         This script will create a SPI directory and install itself there.

         ./Install [your spi_path]

   D) Profile setup.

      - You will have to define the GDB_PATH variable to the location of the geographical database for SPI to use it:
        Depending on the shell you are using, this might mean:

        sh/ksh/bash
           add this line to the .profile or .profile_usr

           export GDB_PATH=[your geo_path]/data

        csh

           add this line to the .cshrc

           setenv GDB_PATH [your geo_path]/data

      - If you want to run scripts, you will have to define an environment variable pointing to the path
        where you installed SPI. Depending on the shell you are using, this might mean:

        sh/ksh/bash

           add this line to the .profile or .profile_usr

           export SPI_PATH=[your spi_path]

        csh

           add this line to the .cshrc

           setenv SPI_PATH [your spi_path]

   E) Run SPI.

      - You can now launch SPI by calling

        [your  spi_path]/SPI

        or

        $SPI_PATH/SPI

        The first time you run it SPI will create a setup directory called .spi in
        your home directory where the parameters are saved. You can edit theses files, primarily
        the one called ~/.spi/SPI, carefully to configure SPI to your likings.
