# Introduction

This repository contains the `operational variable dictionary` files, which are located in two places:
```
# On EC:
/home/binops/afsi/sio/datafiles/constants/opdict

# On Science:
/home/smco502/datafiles/constants/opdict
```

You can update the repos with this [simple and stable CMOI process](https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI/best-practices/blob/master/en/gitlab_simple_stable.md).

# Updates
## To clone the git depot
```bash
git clone git@gitlab.science.gc.ca:CMOI/operational-variable-dictionary.git
```

## To modify the variable dictionary
See the steps outlined on [this wiki page](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/DictOp/Dictionnaire_modifs).

## To have your changes loaded into the official operational variable dictionary
To update the files in `smco50*`, a ticket should be opened in [CMOI-Service-Desk/General](https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI-Service-Desk/General/issues), and not in this project.
